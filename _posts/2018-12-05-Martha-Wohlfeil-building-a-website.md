**_Martha gave a nice presentation about how to build your own website (for free!) using Github and RStudio with RMarkdown._**

## Overview:

>"This tutorial focuses on how to build a website using Rmarkdown and Github. It's geared at folks who have never built a website before, as we will be covering the basics. The assumption is everyone has RStudio/R installed, and a Github account."

## Video of Presentation

We recorded the presentation on youtube for eternal viewing:
