**_Ryan spoke about using the [`aggiedown`](https://github.com/ryanpeek/aggiedown) package to write your dissertation using Rmarkdown, and create an officially formatted (according to UC Davis) pdf!_**

## Overview:

>"Writing your dissertation is hard...formatting it is even harder. If you are interested in using a bookdown/Rmarkdown template that has been formatted for UC Davis specifications to generate a correctly typeset pdf of your dissertation/thesis, please check this out. If it breaks, or if you find/have any problems in formatting, please file an [issue](https://github.com/ryanpeek/aggiedown/issues/new) so we can make this better."
