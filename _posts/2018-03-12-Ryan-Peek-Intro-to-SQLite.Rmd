**_Ryan gave an awesome introduction to SQLite databases_**

##Overview

>This tutorial will cover how you can utilize SQlite databases in R. They are flexible, provide a great way to store all your tables/spreadsheets in a portable format, and work on most any operating system. I'll go over the basics of how to create, access, and read/write to a SQlite database in R, using the dbplyr and RSQLite packages.
