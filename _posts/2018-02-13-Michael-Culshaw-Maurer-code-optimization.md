**_Michael gave a great tutorial & presentation on the perils and perks of optimization of code in R._**

## Overview

 > "Have you ever wished your code ran faster? Have you ever come back from an extended coffee break to find your model still running? Have you ever come close to putting your fist through your computer when your advisor asked why your data weren't analyzed yet? Well, you're not alone. This talk will go through some tools and methods to make sure you have a plan before jumping into optimization willy nilly. I can't promise your models will run faster, but I can promise there will be lots of bad puns and a few cool methods."
