**_Brandon Hurr gave a great tutorial & presentation on using the `purrr` package, and specifically on using the two key function families `map` and `walk` functions.  From Brandon:_**

## Overview

 > `map()` and `walk()` and their derivatives are functional programming tools that are part of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages, and in particular the [`purrr`](http://purrr.tidyverse.org/) package. 

The presentation and tutorial cover the following:

 - Data types in R
 - Functions in R
 - Iteration in R (for loops)
 - `map()`
 - `walk()`

### Important tips

 - In order for you to get the most out of this tutorial I have produced an R markdown document that will let you follow along with all of the functions and examples that I will present. This document uses functions that transverse the `tidyverse` and therefore I would ask that if you plan to follow along on your computer that you install the `tidyverse`."

    - `install.packages("tidyverse")`
