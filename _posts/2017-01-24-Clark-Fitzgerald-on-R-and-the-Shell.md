For our first presentation of the quarter, UC Davis Data Science Initiative affiliate [Clark Fitzgerald](http://clarkfitzg.github.io/) talked to us about tasks that integrate R and the Shell.  From Clark:

   *"I'll provide some motivation and examples of integrating R with the command line, including tools like Rscript, system2(), and commandArgs(). If users have specific tasks or questions please bring them and we'll work on them together."*
