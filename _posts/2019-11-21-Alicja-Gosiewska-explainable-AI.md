**Alicja Gosiewska, a visiting PhD student from Warsaw University of Technology in Poland, talked about the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which she describes here:_**

"I work in the MI2 Data Lab group (http://mi2.mini.pw.edu.pl/) where currently we are focusing on the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Our research aims to develop methods that help to understand how complex machine learning models work and to increase the trust in their predictions. An overview of our work can be found at http://jmlr.org/papers/v19/18-416.html. We also develop many R packages for XAI (http://drwhy.ai)."
