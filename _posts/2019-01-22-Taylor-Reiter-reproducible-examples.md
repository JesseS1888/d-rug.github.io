**_Taylor gave a nice overview about how to create, and ask questions using Reproducible examples (*ReprEX*)._**

## Overview:

>"Given the many questions that get posed on our list-serv, as well as on StackOverflow or other discussion boards, it seemed a good time to have a short talk on what a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) consists of, how to quickly generate a reprex, and why reprex are really key for getting questions answered."
