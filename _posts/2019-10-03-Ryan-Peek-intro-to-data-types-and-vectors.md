**_Ryan taught some of the Data Carpentry Ecology Lesson on [**Intro to R: Data Types/Vectors**](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html). The code from the presentation (live code) is available below. _**

## Overview:

>"We covered how to assign objects in R, how we can name different objects in our R environment, what different data classes exist in R, and how to work with these different classes inside vectors. We also briefly touched on subsetting in vectors using `[ ]`."
