Our fearless co-coordinator [Michael Levy](http://michaellevy.name/) gave a presentation on automation, the apply family, and writing custom functions in R.  From Michael:

   *Access the power of R through the apply-family of functions and by writing your own functions. You’ll save time, headaches,    and mistakes. This is an “advanced-beginner” talk intended to get people started or more comfortable with automation. If you    find yourself copy-and-pasting R code, this is for you! If you have multiple data files to process, this is for you! If you    want to become an R wizard but aren’t sure what the next steps are, this is for you!*

Here's the video!  The R script he uses can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/nn8mlw5ywktz8tg/script.R?dl=0).
