Last Tuesday at the [Davis R Users' Group](http://www.d-rug.github.io), [Brandon Hurr](https://github.com/bhive01) gave a presentation on joins and set operations in R using the [**dplyr**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) package.  Here's the video and a link to his slides.  Brandon's script from the presentation is available [here](https://github.com/bhive01/2016-02-D-RUG-dplyr-II-talk/blob/master/R_Code_Only.R).  Brandon also mentioned several more resources for learning about dplyr - those can be found in his slides after the jump.
