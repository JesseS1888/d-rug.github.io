***"The sweetest R-help group this side of the Mississippi."***

Welcome to the Davis R Users' Group (D-RUG)!  We are a community of R users at UC Davis who support each other in using R for science. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other.

***Come to our weekly work sessions!  For Fall Quarter 2016, weekly work sessions will be be held Thursdays 1pm - 3pm in Wickson 2124.*** 
This is the core purpose of DRUG.  We have weekly, 2-hour work sessions where people bring their computers to work on their own projects, and ask each other questions as needed.  We have no TAs - just mutual support in R, statistics, and related topics.  Group members sometimes give short presentations on R methods and best practices or to get feedback on their projects.
