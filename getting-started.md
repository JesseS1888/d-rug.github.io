### Some tips on getting started:

 - Download R [here](http://cran.cs.wwu.edu/)
 - After you install R, I recommend you install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/).  RStudio is a program that makes R easier to use, and is being widely adopted by both beginning and advanced R users. Importantly, it works across most computer platforms, and has features that make it easy to [share your work](http://rpubs.com/), collaborate, and do [proper version control](http://rstudio.org/docs/version_control/overview).
 - [Google](http://www.google.com) is your first stop for most questions.  You'll most likely reach most of the resources below while searching for your specific question.
 - Our regular R work sessions and [listserv](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug) are great places to ask questions, especially if you are not sure what you are looking for.

### Web Resources

***Everyone learns R differently, for different purposes. Thus, you'll probably
need to learn specialized packages for your field or application. Resources
and books here are general-purpose, with some bent towards ecological statistics
applications.***

There's no need to reinvent the wheel.  Here are lists of beginner's resources which others have compiled. R tools evolve rapidly, though, so be sure to
check that your guide is up-to-date!

 - [Rseek](http://rseek.org/) is a search engine for R resources.
 - RStudio's [Getting Help with R](http://www.rstudio.org/docs/help_with_r) page or [online learning](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#R) page.
