***"The sweetest R-help group this side of the Mississippi."***

Welcome to the Davis R Users' Group (DRUG)!  We are a community of R users at UC Davis who support each other in using R for science. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other.

-   ***Come to our weekly work sessions***: This is the core purpose of DRUG.  We have weekly, 2-hour work sessions where people bring their computers to work on their own projects, and ask each other questions as needed.  We have no TAs - just mutual support in R, statistics, and related topics.  Group members sometimes give short presentations on R methods and best practices or to get feedback on their projects.

    ***For Summer Quarter 2015, weekly work sessions will be be held Tuesdays 10AM-12PM in Wickson Hall Room 2124***

 - ***Join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/davis-rug)***: The mailing list is an online supplement to our in-person work sessions.
 
 - ***Use the resources below***: We've compiled a list of resources to help you get started using R and find answers to your questions.

### R Courses at Davis

There are a few courses at UC Davis that use R.

 - [Duncan Temple Lang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan/) (one of the developers of R) teaches [*Statistical Computing* (STA141)](http://eeyore.ucdavis.edu/stat141/), a course mostly about R but also more general topics in computer science for statistics. He also organizes an informal seminar series on statistical computing.  [STA 242](http://eeyore.ucdavis.edu/stat242/) is a more advanced version of the course.  He also will teach STA 135 - *Multivariate Data Analysis* this year, which is not about R but uses R for data exploration, data mining, and regression.
 - [Richard McElreath](http://xcelab.net/rm/)'s *Statistical Rethinking* (ANT298) is a course in Bayesian statistical methods which doesn't focus on R but teaches enough for the applications in the course.
 - [Marissa Baskett](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/) and [Sebastian Schreiber](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/sschreiber/) teach *Computational methods in population biology* (ECL298) in alternate years. This course also isn't explicitly about R but teaches enough basics so as to be able to use it for the applications in the course.  They also created this handy [cheat sheet](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/downloads/Rcommands.pdf)
 - *Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Experiments* (PLS 205) has in the past provided an optional extra section to learn techniques in R in addition to SAS
 - Carole Hom teaches *Introduction to Dynamic Models in Modern Biology* (BIS 132) where R is used for differential and difference equation modeling.
 - There are occasional [paid workshops](http://www.hafnerconsulting.com/ucd2012/) offered on campus
 - At least one section of STA100 uses R
 - [Robert Hijmans](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/FacultyInfo.aspx?ID_Number=83) teaches *Quantitative Geography* (GEO200CN).  It is a survey course about spatial data analysis and modeling using R, including subjects such as point pattern analysis, kriging, inference, cellular automata and Markov chains. It has lectures, disussions, and a intensive lab.
 - [Jim Fadel](http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/faculty/fadel/) teaches ABG250: *Mathematical Modeling in Biological Systems*, which uses R and teaches enough for the applications in class
 - [Anna Steel](http://biotelemetry.ucdavis.edu/pages/bio_Steel.asp) taught ECL298: *R for Dummies: Basics of data manipulation in R* Winter Quarter 2013. The course may be taught by someone else in the future, but is still up in the air.
 - The political science methods sequence (POL211, POL212, POL213) uses R.
 - [Andrew Latimer](http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/faculty/latimer/index.htm)'s *Applied Statistical Modeling for Environmental Science* (PLS298) uses R in addition to JAGS and OPENBugs. It assumes familiarity with R.
 
### Miscellaneous

 - [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)
 - The [One R Tip A Day Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/RLangTip)
 - [#rstats](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rstats?q=%23rstats) is a common hashtag for discussing R on Twitter

### General Statistics Resources at UC Davis

 - Here is [a page compiling stats and modeling courses](stats.html) that Ecology students can take at UC Davis
 - The UC Davis Department of Statistics has a [consulting service](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/stats-lab/services) that is free for disseration-related statistical advice.  You get a 1-hour meeting with a statistician to discuss your research and they will send you a write-up of their recommendations.
